questionnaire: BIS/BAS
description: |-
  The BIS/BAS Scales, developed by Carver and White (1994), assess two key
  motivational systems: the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) 
  and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS). 
  BIS reflects sensitivity to punishment, avoidance, and anxiety-related responses. 
  BAS reflects sensitivity to reward and is further divided into three subscales:
    - **BAS Drive**: persistence toward goal attainment
    - **BAS Fun Seeking**: spontaneity in approaching new rewarding experiences
    - **BAS Reward Responsiveness**: positive reaction to reward presence or anticipation
  The questionnaire includes 24 items:
    - 7 items for BIS
    - 13 items for BAS, distributed across the three subscales.

measures:
  BIS: Sensitivity to punishment and behavioral inhibition
  BAS Drive: Goal-directed persistence
  BAS Fun Seeking: Desire for new rewards and willingness to approach
  BAS Reward Responsiveness: Response to positive outcomes and reward anticipation

reference_values:
  BIS:
    - Higher scores indicate greater sensitivity to punishment and anxiety proneness.
  BAS:
    - Higher total BAS scores reflect stronger motivational drive toward rewards.
  BAS Drive:
    - Higher values suggest goal persistence and drive capacity.
  BAS Fun Seeking:
    - High scores suggest a propensity for seeking novel pleasurable experiences.
  BAS Reward Responsiveness:
    - High scores indicate strong positive affect in response to reward cues.
