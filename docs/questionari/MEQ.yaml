questionnaire: MEQ
description: |-
  The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), developed by Horne and Östberg in 1976,
  is a self-assessment tool consisting of 19 questions that determine an individual's circadian preference,
  classifying them as “morning type,” “intermediate type,” or “evening type.”
  The total score ranges from 16 to 86. 
  Research has shown that morning types tend to have an earlier circadian peak compared to evening types.
