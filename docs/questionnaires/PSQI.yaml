questionnaire: PSQI
description: |-
  The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), developed in 1989 at the University of Pittsburgh,
  is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over the past month.
  It includes 19 self-rated questions and 5 optional questions for a bed partner or roommate (not scored).
  The PSQI evaluates seven components of sleep: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration,
  habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
  Each component is scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty), yielding a global score ranging from 0 to 21.
  A global score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality.
