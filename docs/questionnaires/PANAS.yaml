questionnaire: PANAS
description: |-
  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), developed by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988),
  is a self-report questionnaire that measures two primary dimensions of mood:
    - **Positive Affect (PA)**: reflects the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert.
    - **Negative Affect (NA)**: reflects subjective distress and unpleasurable engagement.
  The instrument consists of 20 adjectives (10 per scale), each rated on a 5-point Likert scale.
  The Italian version has demonstrated good reliability.
